# Firebase hooks

## Description

While Firebase is a great way to abstract backend interaction for all devs, I believe it could benefit from some hooks love.

Another reason why I'm writing this project is to make firebase as accessible to new users as I can.
I recently had pretty bad experience with explaining configuration, organisation and usage to few new Web Devs and I believe there is too much that is not explained in the docs explicitly, so I might as well attempt to abstract it with custom hooks.

## Currently working on
